AUTOMATED CASHIER (MENU APP)

This is my first attempt in creating an app in RUBY.

Prerequisites
Ruby 2.4 
Text Editor (e.g. Atom, Sublime)
Terminal (for Mac) or Windows Powershell

Installing
The first thing to do is to make sure that you have installed Ruby and a Text Editor in your system.

Running the App
On a Terminal or Powershell run the program by locating the directory of the file and calling "ruby filename.rb"

Provides a selection of Menu by the number and once it is selected it will ask for the quantity. It will then show the Total Menu Amount
and the Total Amount as a whole. The next step is it will ask if you wanted another order and if yes......

The system clears up and will only show the Menu Selection.  After selecting the chosen Menu it will again show the Total Menu Amount and
the Total Amount as a whole.

If there are no more orders, Menu 5 has to be selected and the system will request for Payment.  The system will continually ask
until full payment has been done and change is shown if there is any.
